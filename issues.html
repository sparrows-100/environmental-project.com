  <h1>Environmental Issues Facing Uganda</h1>
  <p>
    Uganda’s environment is under increasing pressure due to human activities,
    population growth, and climate change. These challenges affect livelihoods,
    biodiversity, and sustainable development.

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Deforestation</h2>
    <p>
      Large areas of forest are cleared for charcoal burning, timber, farming,
      and settlement.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Loss of wildlife habitats, reduced rainfall,
      soil erosion, climate change, and scarcity of firewood.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change has caused unpredictable weather patterns including prolonged
      droughts, intense rainfall, and rising temperatures.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Crop failure, food insecurity, water shortages,
      flooding, and increased poverty.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
    <p>
      Rivers and lakes are polluted by industrial waste, untreated sewage,
      agricultural chemicals, and plastic waste.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Waterborne diseases, death of aquatic life,
      unsafe drinking water, and reduced fish stocks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Wetland Destruction</h2>
    <p>
      Wetlands are drained for farming, construction, and industrial development
      despite their importance to the ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Increased flooding, loss of biodiversity,
      water purification failure, and climate imbalance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>
      Many plant and animal species are threatened due to habitat destruction,
      pollution, and illegal hunting.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Species extinction, ecosystem imbalance,
      reduced tourism revenue, and loss of medicinal plants.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Overfishing</h2>
    <p>
      Excessive and illegal fishing practices reduce fish populations in major
      lakes like Lake Victoria.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Decline in fish stocks, loss of income,
      food insecurity, and ecosystem disruption.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Encroachment on Protected Areas</h2>
    <p>
      Human settlement and farming activities are expanding into national parks
      and forest reserves.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Human-wildlife conflict, habitat loss,
      reduced tourism, and biodiversity decline.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Urbanization Pressure</h2>
    <p>
      Rapid urban growth without proper planning increases pollution and
      strains infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Traffic congestion, poor sanitation,
      air pollution, and increased disease outbreaks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Land Degradation</h2>
    <p>
      Poor farming methods, overgrazing, and deforestation degrade soil quality.
    </p>

    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Reduced crop yields, desertification,
      poverty, and food insecurity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Plastic Pollution</h2>
    <p>
      Improper disposal of plastic waste is common in urban and rural areas.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Blocked drainage, flooding, wildlife deaths,
      and long-term soil contamination.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Indoor Air Pollution</h2>
    <p>
      Many households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking in poorly
      ventilated spaces.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Respiratory diseases, eye problems,
      and premature deaths.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Flooding</h2>
    <p>
      Flooding is becoming more frequent due to climate change and poor
      drainage systems.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Destruction of homes, loss of lives,
      crop damage, and disease outbreaks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Drought</h2>
    <p>
      Extended dry periods affect water supply and agricultural productivity.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Hunger, livestock deaths, water scarcity,
      and increased poverty.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="issue-card">
    <h2>Mining and Quarrying</h2>
    <p>
      Unregulated mining activities damage land and pollute water sources.
    </p>
    <p class="effects"><strong>Effects:</strong> Land degradation, water contamination,
      health risks, and ecosystem destruction.
